
Use given Iris dataset and solve the following quesions:

1. Check the missing values in a given Dataset i.e., is NaN
3. Show the count of different types of species
4. Find the max,min and mean in values of any two species

Your goal is to predict the species in a given dataset by considering target variable as "target" 
and feature variable as "petal length".

5. Apply Linear Regression to the given dataset without splitting dataset and Check the R squared score
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and Check the R squared score

Draw a graph:

7. Scatterplot for sepal length and petal length
8. Jointplot for sepal length and sepal width
9. Bargraph for any one feature
10. Boxplot for species and sepal width
